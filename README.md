6. Create User

    - Send Mail to: team@innkeepr.ai

## Customize the following files
- >aws_infrastructure.sh:
    - insert "your" AWS ID in YOURAWSID
- >policy_lambda.json
    - insert the AWSID from the Innkeepr User for InnkeeprAWSID

## Policies
The policies can be found in the directory Policies. In general the polcies allow the whole access to each AWS component. If you want to restrict the accesss you can modify the single json files, e.g.to allwo access to a certain SÂ§ bucket (noramly we call the bucket for Innkeer: innkeepr-analytics).
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "S3Access",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::innkeepr-analytics/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::innkeepr-analytics*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Next Run Set Up Scrit
> sh aws_infrastructure.sh

In the beginning you need to log in to your AWS account via your Access Keys. So be preadred to have them accessable.
